Step 1:
- GitHub is a collaboration platform that uses Git for versioning. GitHub is a popular place to share and contribute to open-source software.
- A repository is a project containing files and folders. A repository tracks versions of files and folders.
- A branch is a parallel version of your repository. By default, your repository has one branch named main and it is considered to be the definitive branch. Creating additional branches allows you to copy the main branch of your repository and safely make any changes without disrupting the main project. Many people use branches to work on specific features without affecting any other parts of the project.

Step 2:
- A commit is a set of changes to the files and folders in your project. A commit exists in a branch.

Step 3:
- Collaboration happens on a pull request. The pull request shows the changes in your branch to other people and allows people to accept, reject, or suggest additional changes to your branch.

Step 4:
- A merge adds the changes in your pull request and branch into the main branch.
