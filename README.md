# a-bike-sharing-business-analysis-project

This self-directed project currently includes two reports: one is the original analysis conducted in Google Sheets, and the other is a comparative analysis implemented in Python.

The original **Bike-sharing Business Analysis** focuses on its comprehensive analytics workflow, from asking targeted questions and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to delivering actionable insights and crafting a compelling data story.

On the other hand, the subsequent comparative analysis (**Bike-sharing Business Analysis with Python**) is designed to validate the initial findings obtained previously and to explore different methodological approaches, ensuring the accuracy and integrity of the business insights delivered.

*Notes: This is a record of my professional journey. More files, such as Python coding, might be added later.*
